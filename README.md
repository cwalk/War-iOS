## Introduction

This was one of my first iOS apps, written in Swift. It mimics the card game called War, where two players split a deck of cards, and flip them over. The player with the higher value card wins a point.

## Usage

Download the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cwalk/War-iOS`

Navigate into the project directory: `cd War-iOS/War/`

Open the Xcode project: `open War.xcodeproj/`

Build and run the project.
